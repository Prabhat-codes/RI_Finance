Switch over to the postgres account on your server by typing:

sudo -i -u postgres

You can now access a Postgres prompt immediately by typing:
psql

This will log you into the PostgreSQL prompt, and from here you are free to interact with the database management system right away.

Exit out of the PostgreSQL prompt by typing:
\q

This will bring you back to the postgres Linux command prompt.

\c DATABASE NAME connects you to the database you want to in terminal 

CREATE TABLE playground (
    equip_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    type varchar (50) NOT NULL,
    color varchar (25) NOT NULL,
    location varchar(25) check (location in ('north', 'south', 'west', 'east', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'southwest', 'northwest')),
    install_date date
);

INSERT INTO playground (type, color, location, install_date) VALUES ('slide', 'blue', 'south', '2017-04-28');
INSERT INTO playground (type, color, location, install_date) VALUES ('swing', 'yellow', 'northwest', '2018-08-16');

SELECT * FROM playground;


DELETE FROM playground WHERE type = 'slide';

Adding columns
ALTER TABLE playground ADD last_maint date; 

Dropping columns
ALTER TABLE playground DROP last_maint;

Updating specific data 
UPDATE playground SET color = 'red' WHERE type = 'swing';
